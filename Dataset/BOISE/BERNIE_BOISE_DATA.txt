@meyrude In that case, Bernie would surpass the goal too, wouldn't he?
@likatmur88 @DannyEFreeman @maddow @BernieSanders he polls against trump far better than clinton. she is doing that not bernie.
@meyrude There are 1,168 exactly. At the rate that the primaries have been going, Bernie could very well tie Hillary before the convention.
@meyrude So you're saying it's okay that the Superdelegates in this election are largely disregarding the popular vote of their states?
@meyrude The system that Bernie signed up for is the same one that he's running against in this case.

After losing the Indiana primary to Donald Trump, Ted Cruz is announcing that he is ending his campaign for president of the United States.
Cruz bows out. Finally. 
Now, if Trump, Hillary, Bernie and Kasich can follow suit, all will be restored.
