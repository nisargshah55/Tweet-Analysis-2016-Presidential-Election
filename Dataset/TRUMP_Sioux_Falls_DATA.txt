@shanevanderhart Using subtraction, it does. A vote for write-in is one less vote for Trump, which equates to one more vote for Hillary.
Political plot twist 2016: Trump wins and then resigns so he can go back to being Donald with the president he hand picked.
The GOP of McConnell, Rubio et al is getting exactly what it deserves, but I would say the Trump campaign killed it with a decided bang.
The only reason #Conservatives vote #GOP for president is because there is no other logical option. If we vote 3rd party the Dems win #tcot
