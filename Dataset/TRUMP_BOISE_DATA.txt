@kimguilfoyle Thank you so much for presenting such credible arguments to Juan Williams and others on The 5.
#Trump 2016
Thank you #CruzCrew. You have convinced me by your irrational reaction towards #trump I have picked the right candidate for this country.
@SouthernKeeks that's acceptable. But it won't be trump voters who put Clinton in office. It will be 3rd party or stay home republicans.
@SouthernKeeks trump is going to win the presidency IMO. But even if he doesn't, he will be the republican candidate.
