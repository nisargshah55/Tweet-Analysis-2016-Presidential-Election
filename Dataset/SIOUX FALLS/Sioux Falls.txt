Run afoul of US Constitution as presidential candidate says all I need to know about where America headed if that bastard become President
2016 presidential election isnt even legal based on the fact 3 life long DEMOCRATS run for highest office.
Presidential election is not giving a fair shake. There are 3 DEMOCRATS. No Independents and no Republicans
I don't think America should elect any president in 2016. We need to b single for a few years and find ourselves.

2016 presidential election isnt even legal based on the fact 3 life long DEMOCRATS run for highest office.
Presidential election is not giving a fair shake. There are 3 DEMOCRATS. No Independents and no Republicans
I don't think America should elect any president in 2016. We need to b single for a few years and find ourselves.

Why Donald Trump apply as Republican presidential nominee in first place. Suddenly switch sides. But hasn't done the work to be accepted

@shanevanderhart Using subtraction, it does. A vote for write-in is one less vote for Trump, which equates to one more vote for Hillary.
Political plot twist 2016: Trump wins and then resigns so he can go back to being Donald with the president he hand picked.
The GOP of McConnell, Rubio et al is getting exactly what it deserves, but I would say the Trump campaign killed it with a decided bang.
The only reason #Conservatives vote #GOP for president is because there is no other logical option. If we vote 3rd party the Dems win #tcot
